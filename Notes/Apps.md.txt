## Model-driven Apps
- Model-driven app design is a component-focused approach to app development. 
- Model-driven app design does not require code, and the apps you make can be simple or very complex. 
- Unlike canvas app development, where the designer has complete control over app layout, much of the layout is determined for you with model-driven apps and largely designated by the components you add to the app.
